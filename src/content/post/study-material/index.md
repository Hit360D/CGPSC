Let's get to the point, beginner or a veteran, these study materials are time tested and recommended by toppers as essential materials. However, choose what suits you.

## Prelims

### The essentials

The following cover the Chhattisgarh General Studies portion for Prelims [and most of the CG GS portion of Mains syllabus].

- Chhattisgarh General Studies by Hariram Publications [Available in English and Hindi]

- Chhattisgarh Economic Survey summary by E Pathshala [Only in Hindi][Check if any decent English compilation is available]

- Vinay Kumar Pathak's Hindi & Chhattisgarhi [Both are separate books]

### India portion

Ideally you should refer to materials considered 'Standard sources' on an All India Level i.e what the UPSC CSE aspirants are referring to. However, you choose material based on your own analysis of input:output ratio per subject.

These are my recommendations.

- M Laxmikanth for Polity

- Barnwal for Indian Geography

- Old NCERTs for Indian History

### Practice

You should be solving topic wise questions given the repetition is significant.

You can choose either or both of the following question banks for CG GS. Objective question banks for CG GS are only available in Hindi as of now.

- Tuteja Tutorial's Pratiyogita Saransh Chhattisgarh objective question bank [Available for India GS as well but I recommend better resources]

- Hariram Publication's Chhattisgarh objective question bank [Focused more on newer questions as compared to Pratiyogita Saransh]

For India GS question banks covering All India exams are superior. I recommend the following.

- Ghatnachakra objective question banks [Available in both English and Hindi][Separate question bank for every subject covered in Prelims]

### Previous Year Papers

You need previous year papers for your analysis. You can refer either directly to the original question papers [time consuming] or get the following that magically appeared in the market recently.

- Arihant publication's CGPSC Preliminary Examination Yearwise-Topicwise solved papers [Available in both English & Hindi]
