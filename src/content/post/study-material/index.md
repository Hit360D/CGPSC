Let's get to the point, beginner or a veteran, these study materials are time tested and recommended by toppers as essential materials. However, choose what suits you.

## Prelims

### The essentials

The following cover the Chhattisgarh General Studies portion for Prelims [and most of the CG GS portion of Mains syllabus].

- Chhattisgarh General Studies by Hariram Publications [Available in English and Hindi]

- Chhattisgarh Economic Survey summary by E Pathshala

- Vinay Kumar Pathak's Hindi & Chhattisgarhi [Both are separate books]

### India portion

Ideally you should refer to materials considered 'Standard sources' on an All India Level i.e what the UPSC CSE aspirants are referring to. However, you choose material based on your own analysis of input:output ratio per subject.

These are my recommendations.

- M Laxmikanth for Polity

- Barnwal for Indian Geography

- Old NCERTs for Indian History
